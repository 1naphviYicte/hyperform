<p align="center">A next-gen serverless deployer
<br>For AWS Lambda & Google Cloud Functions</p>

## Install

```sh
$ npm install -g hyperform-cli
```


## Usage

```
$ hf init 
$ hf deploy [--url]
```

### ‚úçÔ∏è Write normal JavaScript


```js
/**
 * @param {*} input Function input. How you pass it depends on how you call it.
 * @param {{ method: string, headers: {*} }?} http Only populated if called via GET or POST
 **/
function greet({ name }, http) {
  if(http.method != null) {
    console.log(`Apparently I was invoked via ${http.method}`)
    console.log(`HTTP headers: ${http.headers}`)
  }

  return { greeting: `Hi from AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions, ${name} !` }
}


module.exports = {
// Hyperform looks for CommonJS exports matching '*endpoint*'
  endpointGreet: greet 
}
```

### üîç Infer your AWS or Google Cloud credentials

```sh
$ hf init
‚úì Created hyperform.json
```

### üöÄ Deploy exports as functions

```sh 
$ hf deploy --url
üü¢ endpointGreet https://ltirihayh9.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/endpointGreet
   # or
üü¢ endpointGreet https://us-central1-myproject.cloudfunctions.net/endpointGreet
```

If you don't want to make your functions public, omit the `--url` flag.

<!-- 
## Invoke 

Your functions  detect from where they are invoked (GET, POST, Provider console, SNS event) so they always receive the same payload.

For instance, you can GET or POST to them.
Or you can use them internally with the provider.

```sh
#######
# GET #
#######

$ curl https://us-central1-myproj.cloudfunctions.net/endpointEcho?a=1

> {"Hi from AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions!
      GET or POST body received: {\"a\":1}}"

########
# POST #
########

$ curl \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ 
  -d '{"a":1}' \
  https://us-central1-myproj.cloudfunctions.net/endpointEcho

> {"Hi from AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions!
      GET or POST body received: {\"a\":1}}"
``` -->

## Tips

* Hyperform deploys each CommonJS export named `*endpoint*` as function
* The first argument always an object. It is the parsed POST body, the parsed GET query string, or the unchanged SNS, Google PubSub, Google Storage (...) event. The default is `{}`.
* The second argument, if called via HTTP is `{ method: GET|POST, headers: { ... } }`. The default is `{}`.
* You can import anything. Webpack is used to bundle all dependencies.
* You can export anywhere. Your endpoints can be spread over multiple files.
* Included per default are `aws-sdk` and `@google/`.
