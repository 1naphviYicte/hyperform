## ðŸ“¦ Install

```sh
$ npm install -g hyperform-cli
```
TODO simple serverless app instead,
TODO put code first

## ðŸ§ª Basic Example

### Infer your Cloud Credentials

Hyperform deploys code to the cloud accounts it finds in `hyperform.json`. Hyperform can infer them from your machine:

```
hyperform init
> Created hyperform.json
``` 

:warning: You should not commit `hyperform.json` to version control. Hyperform will add `hyperform.json` to `.gitignore`.

### Mark endpoints in your code

To tell Hyperform which endpoints to deploy, include `endpoint` in their name, and export them using `exports` or `module.exports`:

```js
exports.endpointGreet = ({ name }) => {
 return { msg: `Hello, ${name}!` }
}
```

### Deploy to the Cloud

```sh 
$ hyperform deploy --allow-unauthenticated

âœ“  Amazon  endpointGreet https://gmlpjhayh9.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com

```
