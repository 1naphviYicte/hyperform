The film is notorious for its explicit sex scenes featuring Vivian Hsu, who was only 20 years old at the time. She later regretted doing the film and said it was a mistake. She also said she was tricked into signing the contract and did not know what kind of film it was. She tried to sue the producer for using her nude photos without her consent, but lost the case.
